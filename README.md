# Neural Networks for Classification

Academic project on neural network classification with regularization and model comparison.

- Shallow and deep neural networks
- Regularization techniques (early stopping, dropout)
- Comparison with Lasso and LassoNet models

Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn
